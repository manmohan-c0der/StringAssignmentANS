String it refers to an Object in java present in package called java.lang.String

String refers to collection of characters

In Java String object is by default immutable,meaning once the object is created
we cannot change the value of the object, if we try to change then those changes
will be reflected on the new object not on the existing object.

In java Strings are classified into 2 types

1. Mutable String

2. Immutable String

Ans 3
There are two ways to create a String object: By string literal : Java String literal is created by using double quotes. For Example: String s=“Welcome”; By new keyword : Java String is created by using a keyword “new”.

Ans 4
A string constant pool is a separate place in the heap memory where the values of all the strings which are defined in the program are stored. When we declare a string, an object of type String is created in the stack, while an instance with the value of the string is created in the heap

Ans 5
Once if we create a String, on that String if we try to perform any operation and
if those changes get reflected in the same object then such strings are called
“Mutable String”.

Example: StringBuffer, StringBuilder

Once if we create a String, on that String if we try to perform any operation
then those changes won’t be reflected in the same object, rather a new object
will be created.Such type of String is called as “Immutable String”.

Example: String

String pool is a storage space in the Java heap memory where string literals are stored. It is also known as String Constant Pool or String Intern Pool
